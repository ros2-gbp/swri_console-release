# swri_console

![screenshot](doc/images/screenshot.png)

swri_console is an alternative to rqt_console for viewing the ROS console output.  swri_console was written to scale well to large systems with heavy console output.  It stays responsive under fire and allows users to quickly find information to track down problems.

### Features

- High performance; swri_console handles receiving thousands of logs per second and storing millions in memory while staying responsive
- Ctrl or shift-click to quickly select which nodes you want to monitor
- Hide or show log messages based on substring matches, or, if you need more power, regular expressions
- Hide, show, and colorize log messages based on severity
- Save and load log messages to text files
- Save and load log messages directly from the `/rosout` topic in a bag file
- Right-click on nodes to dynamically set their logger levels
   - *Not supported in ROS 2 yet*
